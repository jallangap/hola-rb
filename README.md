## Deployment and Continuous Integration

This project can be deployed using Railway, a platform that simplifies deployment with automatic integration from GitHub repositories.

1. **Connecting to Railway**: 
   After pushing changes to the GitHub repository, Railway will automatically detect updates in the repository and begin the deployment process.

2. **Deployment Status**:
   Upon a successful deployment, Railway displays a **Deployment successful** message, confirming that the application is live and functioning as expected.

3. **GitHub Integration**:
   GitHub provides continuous integration feedback on each push. After tests and checks are completed, a **All checks have passed** message will appear in the repository, with indicators like **2 successful checks**, ensuring that the project is stable and ready for production.

These integrations help maintain deployment consistency and verify code integrity before changes are live.
